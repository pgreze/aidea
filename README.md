## Features

### Open a project with IDEA

```bash
$ aidea ./my-project
  1: IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.3, build IC-222.434
     /Users/pgreze/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/IDEA-C/ch-0/222.4345.14/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app

  2: Android Studio 2021.3, build AI-213.7172
     /Users/pgreze/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/AndroidStudio/ch-1/213.7172.25.2113.9014738/Android Studio.app

Which installation to use? 2
```

This is the default behavior of generated idea/studio/whatever
commands this project is aiming to replace.

### List available IDEA installations

```bash
$ aidea
/Users/pgreze/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/IDEA-C/ch-0/222.4345.14/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app
/Users/pgreze/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/AndroidStudio/ch-1/213.7172.25.2113.9014738/Android Studio.app
```

### Open a .main.kts file with IDEA

```bash
$ aidea ./hello.main.kts
```

This will generate and launch a tiny gradle project,
enough to run your .main.kts file with
all IDEA features like auto-completion, etc.

Disclaimer: this is a convenient way to edit .main.kts files,
but consider [kscript](https://github.com/kscripting/kscript)
for more advanced uses.
